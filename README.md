# Big picture

![The setup for the FIT repo](fit-deploy-sketch.png)

1. Try out new changes in a feature branch off of main (or off of dev)
2. Merge changes into dev. Once merged in, use a github action to build the html pages and deploy them to 3.
3. The fit-dev repo is hosted on github pages. Navigate to noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/fit-dev to preview the FIT website.
4. Once confirming the dev pages look good, merge changes into 4. Once merged in, use a github acion to build the html pages and deploy them to 5.
5. This is the production version of the NOAA fisheries site, advertised to the public.

# Webpage addresses on production

 - FIT landing page (https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/ ; no change)
 - browse landing page (https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/browse; new page)
 - individual drawer landing pages (if we still want these) (https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/nmfs-fish-tools , for example; CHANGE from nmfs-fish-tools.github.io). 
 - individual tool landing pages, toolbox hosted (https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/ASAP, for example; CHANGE from nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/ASAP)

 # redirect pages
 - will need the nmfs-fish-tools.github.io (and other org .io repos) to redirect; same with nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/toolname. Maybe just upload a new link to post for a bit.

# Org Templating

This repository includes templates and JSON data for the FIT. [python's jinja 2](https://zetcode.com/python/jinja/) is used to generate webpages from the html templates and JSON files (For R users, this approach is similar to using [glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org/)).

## How to update or add tool landing pages 
1. In [model_list_dir subfolder](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/toolbox_web_templating/tree/main/model_list_dir) add or update `.json` files (use [empty.json](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/toolbox_web_templating/blob/main/model_list_dir/EcoSys_model_list/empty.json) as a template if itâ€™s a new tool). Examples of json are available in [model_list_dir/MODEL_LIST_NOTES.json](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/toolbox_web_templating/blob/main/model_list_dir/MODEL_LIST_NOTES.json)
2. If it is a new tool, add to the x_config.json file for the drawer it should be in.
3. In toolbox_web_templating [actions](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/toolbox_web_templating/actions), run the workflow "create html" for the drawer the new tool goes in 
4. Download the `index.html` created by the action (to find this, click into the action after it runs, the `index.html` will be at the bottom)
5. Replace the `index.html` in the github.io repo for whichever drawer the new tool is in: 
- [Fish and Fisheries](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/nmfs-fish-tools.github.io)
- [Protected Species](https://github.com/NMFS-Protected-Species-Tools/nmfs-protected-species-tools.github.io) 
- [Human Dimensions](https://github.com/nmfs-human-dimensions-tools/nmfs-human-dimensions-tools.github.io)
- [Ecosystems](https://github.com/NMFS-ecosystem-tools/nmfs-ecosystem-tools.github.io)
- [General Modeling Tools](https://github.com/nmfs-general-modeling-tools/nmfs-general-modeling-tools.github.io)

Each landing page can be created using the correct config file.

# Explanation of JSON metadata
JSON data can be (partially) validated using [schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/about.html)
```json

  "noaa_internal": false, //Maintained by NOAA? true or false.

# Creating Webpages Locally From Templates

Python and Jinja2 need to be installed locally.
```
pip install jinja2
```


From bash, run:

```
python create_tool_landing_page.py
python create_catalog_landing_page.py Browse_config.json
```

This is just the commands in create_html.yml. Note that this will create new
webpages that should not be saved to the repository.

To view the webpages from VS code, try using the Live Preview Extension.
You may need to add .html to the end of a link in order to view it properly. Sometimes the 
embedded preview doesn't work, so a separate browser window will need to be opened instead.
