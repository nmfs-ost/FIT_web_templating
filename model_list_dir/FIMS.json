A team of experts within NOAA Fisheries is designing and developing the system, and we are advised by the FIMS Council which includes academic, industry, and international partners. We have an operational software system that was released to the public in 2023 and is ready for beta testing, although it is still under active development. Users and developers are welcome to submit feedback using Github issues. ",
