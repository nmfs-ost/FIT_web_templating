ATL leverages the power of template metaprogramming for flexibility, extensibility, and speed. This guide is intended to give the user a basic understanding of how to develop programs in ATL. The information in this document is intended for anyone interested in scientific computing in C++ and it is expected that the reader will have a basic understanding of the C++ programming language, as well as scientific computing.",
