A bootstrap algorithm allows the user to investigate various sampling approaches including sampling strategy (proportional or fixed otolith sampling, POS or FOS, respectively), sample size, supplementation with fishery-independent sampling, and assumptions regarding von Bertalanffy t0 and the relationship between variance of length at age and age. A function to produce plots of the bootstrap sampling results is also provided.",
