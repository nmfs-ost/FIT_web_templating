  "background_text": "An individual-based model (IBM) incorporating within-population variability in von Bertalanffy growth, size-dependent natural mortality, and a size-selective fishery to simulate an exploited fish population and catch (harvest). A bootstrap algorithm allows the user to investigate various sampling approaches including sampling strategy (proportional or fixed otolith sampling, POS or FOS, respectively), sample size, supplementation with fishery-independent sampling, and assumptions regarding von Bertalanffy t0 and the relationship between variance of length at age and age. A function to produce plots of the bootstrap sampling results is also provided.",
