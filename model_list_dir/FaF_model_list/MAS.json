  "background_text": "The Metapopulation System (MAS) is a next generation modeling approach to account for spatially-explicit population and fishery dynamics. The primary goal of the MAS project is to build an modular software system with object-oriented design and extensibility. MAS uses the Analytics Template Library (ATL) to optimize non-linear stock assessment models and supports ensemble modeling and parallelization. It is written in C++ and uses object-oriented programming to provide flexibility in model dimensions. MAS is currently under development and testing.",
