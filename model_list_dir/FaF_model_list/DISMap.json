  "background_text": "The Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal is a national web application which displays data from NOAA Fisheries bottom trawl surveys for five regions - Northeast, Southeast, Gulf of Mexico, West Coast, and Alaska. The portal includes a map viewer and  graphing capabilities for over 800 marine fish and invertebrate species caught during the surveys. DisMAP is being developed in phases, with this release of version 1.0 as the first phase of its ongoing development. The plan is for future releases to include additional data types, model outputs, and functionality. Version 1.0 presents distribution information obtained from NOAA Fisheries bottom trawl surveys, and enables analysis of single species distributions as well as a regional summary of community level distribution shifts. Planned additions for future releases include:  (1) data from other surveys (e.g. PIFSC and Canada DFO), (2) two additional analysis modules focused on multispecies interactions and species availability to fishing ports, and (3) species distribution model outputs (both hindcast and forecasts/projections). Evaluation of additional future data types, model outputs, or functionalities to potentially incorporate into the portal will be the role of the DisMAP steering committee/working group.",
