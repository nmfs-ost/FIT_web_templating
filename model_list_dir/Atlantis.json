  "background_text": "Atlantis an ecosystem model that considers all parts of marine ecosystems – biophysical, economic and social. Originally focused on the biophysical world and then fisheries it has grown to begin to be used for multiple use and climate questions. Atlantis is a deterministic biogeochemical whole of ecosystem model. It’s overall structure is based around the Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) approach, where there is a sub-model (or module) for each of the major steps in the adaptive management cycle.
