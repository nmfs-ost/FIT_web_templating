  "background_text": "The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm for updating linear projections of the system comprised by of an Observation Equation and a State Equation. <p>Observation Equation: y<sub>t</sub> = q<sub>t</sub>b<sub>t</sub> + v<sub>t</sub> </p><p> State Equation: b<sub>t</sub> = b<sub>t-1</sub> - w<sub>t</sub> </p><p>The user will supply a vector of observations, coefficients of variation on observation error and scale vector (q<sub>t</sub>).  The model will estimate two parameters: the state variable at time zero (b<sub>0</sub>) and the standard error on the state variable (s<sub>w</sub>). The model will return a vector of Filtered and Smoothed observations.</p>",
